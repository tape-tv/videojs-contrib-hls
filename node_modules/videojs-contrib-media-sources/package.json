  "readme": "# videojs-media-sources\n\nA [Media Source Extensions](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-media/raw-file/tip/media-source/media-source.html) plugin for video.js.\n\nMedia Source Extensions (MSE) is a W3C draft specification that makes it possible to feed data directly to a video element.\nMSE allows video developers to build functionality like adaptive streaming directly in javascript.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe plugin exposes a MediaSource shim that can be used to feed dynamic content to a video element.\nOn browsers that natively support Media Source Extensions, the HTML implementation will be used.\nIf you're running in an environment without MSE, a Flash-backed polyfill will be used.\nCurrently, the Flash polyfill only supports video content encoded in the FLV file format.\nFor information on how FLVs are structured, Adobe hosts the [latest version of the spec](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/f4v.html) on their site.\n\nThe Flash polyfill attempts to balance throughput to the FLV with end-user responsiveness by asynchronously feeding bytes to the SWF at a fixed rate.\nBy default, that rate is capped at 4MB/s.\nIf you'd like to play higher bitrate content, you can adjust that setting:\n\n```javascript\n// 8MB/s at 60fps\nvideojs.MediaSource.MAX_APPEND_SIZE = Math.ceil((8 * 1024 * 1024) / 60);\n```\nSetting the `MAX_APPEND_SIZE` too high may lead to dropped frames during playback on slower computers.\n\nCheck out an example of the plugin in use in [example.html](example.html).\n\n## Release History\n\n * 0.3.0: Delegate SourceBuffer.abort() calls to the SWF\n * 0.2.0: Improve interactivity by batching communication with Flash.\n * 0.1.0: Initial release\n\n## License\n\nSee [LICENSE-APACHE2](LICENSE-APACHE2).\n",
